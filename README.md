<!-- badges: end -->

This is a package with functions for the internal use and adapted to own
purposes. The functions included here are extensions to `taxlist`
(<https://github.com/kamapu/taxlist>) and `vegtable`
(<https://github.com/kamapu/vegtable>) and its functions may not work
with any database.

## Updating to the last version of vegtable

The very first step is to install the package
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) and dependencies. Then
you just need to execute following commands in your R-session:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("kamapu/vegtable2")
```
